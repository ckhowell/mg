All our Splashbacks are custom made to measure to the exact mm and are toughened to ensure they will cope with heat and humidity which can be created if placed behind a stove top or kettle. We use the highest quality star fire glass which is a lead free, low iron glass that is renowned for its crystal-like clarity. This type of glass reduces the effects of any colour change which some cheaper options may not. 

> Our team at Millennium Glass are experts and are always going to assist you in choosing the right colour, features and size of your splashback.

Our splashbacks have a large variety of design options to choose from – You can choose any colour you want to suit your decor. Just let our team know and we’ll get it done.
