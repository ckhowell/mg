All our mirrors are made to measure and custom cut to the exact millimetre. They are A grade quality silver float glass with thickness varying from either 4mm or 6mm depending on type. All our glass is quality checked to ensure it is free from waves and imperfections. Larger sized mirrors will be 6mm, thicker glass which helps make them more rigid and reduces the possibility of breaking. We use an edge sealant, which is specially formulated for a clear coating to reduce silver deterioration.
