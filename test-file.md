  feature-copy: Foresty CMS allows content editors to easily manage a staticly generated
    site without needing to know markdown or HTML. This works really well if you're
    just editing a page with a title and a body, but sometimes you need to offer more
    diversity. Luckily Forestry has a Block Field which allows a content editor to
    easily add robust content to a page.
