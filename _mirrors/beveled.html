intro: A beveled mirror adds style and chic that you can't normally get from a usual mirror. The right beveled mirror will uplift your bathroom giving it a glamourous look.
process: Free measure and quote to a blank canvas or existing bathroom. Measuring to the exact millimeter, a screen to suit your taste and budget. Repair or replace an outdated existing mirror or frame mirror to modernise.
quality: Our Mirrors are A Grade Quality silver float glass. Thickness from either 4mm and 6mm. All quality checked, glass is free from waves and imperfections. Larger mirrors will be 6mm, thicker glass which helps make them more rigid and reduces the possibility of breaking. We use an edge sealant, a specially formulated clear coating to reduce silver deterioration.
