intro: A frameless mirror perfectly complements a frameless showerscreen and can be
  custom sized to suit any bathroom.
process: Free measure and quote to a blank canvas or existing bathroom. Measuring
  to the exact millimeter, a screen to suit your taste and budget. Repair or replace
  an outdated existing mirror or frame mirror to modernise.
quality: Our Mirrors are A Grade Quality silver float glass. Thickness from either
  4mm and 6mm. All quality checked, glass is free from waves and imperfections. Larger
  mirrors will be 6mm, thicker glass which helps make them more rigid and reduces
  the possibility of breaking. We use an edge sealant, a specially formulated clear
  coating to reduce silver deterioration.
