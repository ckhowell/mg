intro: We focus on the foremost quality in the products and services we offer.
process: Free measure and quote to a blank canvas or existing bathroom. Measuring
  to the exact millimeter, a screen to suit your taste and budget. Repair or replace
  an outdated existing door or frame screen to modernise. If budget allows there are
  options for textured or obscured glass, architectural styles and options for something
  different.
quality: We use the best and not cheap inferior imported products. Glass — We use
  toughened monolithic glass, manufactured in factory. Using this glass prevents de-lamination,
  it's also longer lasting and easier to clean. Frames — We use only quality Dias
  Extrusions. Dias are Australian made and have established a reputation for quality
  and design.
