                    <h5>Why are your products custom-built? Do you offer any stock products?</h5>
                    <p>
                        We custom-build our shower screens and wardrobes to fit perfectly, accounting for the angles of
                        the floor and walls. For shower screens, this is necessary to prevent leaks and unsightly excess
                        silicone work. For wardrobes, this is necessary for the doors to roll properly.
                        We do supply stock frameless panels that are cheap and look good but come only at certain
                        measurements. We also can supply high-quality hardware for DIY purposes. You can find our
                        catalogue [here].

                    <h5>What is the difference between the types of shower screens do you offer?</h5>
                    <p>
                        We supply framed, semi-frameless and frameless options.
                        Framed screens are fully framed with aluminium and while they need more maintenance, they are
                        our cheapest option and the most watertight.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Semi-frameless screens are partially framed with aluminium but has polished glass edges around
                        the front of the screen that gives it a very sleek look. It is our second-cheapest option that
                        fits into any modern home.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Frameless screens are polished glass panels secured to the wall with small metal brackets and
                        silicone. The lack of a frame gives these panels a very elegant appearance, though they are our
                        most expensive option as the glass must be thicker to make it sturdier.
