                <p />Our Mirrors are A Grade Quality silver float glass. Thickness from either 4mm and 6mm.
                <p />All quality checked, glass is free from waves and imperfections. Larger mirrors will be 6mm, thicker glass which helps make them more rigid and reduces the possibility of breaking.
                <p />We use an edge sealant, a specially formulated clear coating to reduce silver deterioration.
