                    <p>
                        Your warranty covers any faults or defects caused by unsatisfactory workmanship under Australian law. If the fault is minor, we will compensate you with a replacement, repair or refund. If the fault is irreparable, you may choose a replacement or refund at your own
                        discretion.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After 14 days, any faults that arise due to improper maintenance or the environment will not be covered under this warranty. However, we will be able to help you with any problems for a reasonable service fee.

                    <p>
                        Under Australian law, your warranty may be voided in cases where the product in question has not been maintained properly, where instructions on our warranty card were not followed, where the product was still used after the defect became noticeable, where the goods are not
                        used for their intended purpose and/or any modifications were made to the product.

                    <h5>What is the difference between the types of shower screens do you offer?</h5>
                    <p>
                        We supply framed, semi-frameless and frameless options.
                        Framed screens are fully framed with aluminium and while they need more maintenance, they are
                        our cheapest option and the most watertight.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Semi-frameless screens are partially framed with aluminium but has polished glass edges around
                        the front of the screen that gives it a very sleek look. It is our second-cheapest option that
                        fits into any modern home.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Frameless screens are polished glass panels secured to the wall with small metal brackets and
                        silicone. The lack of a frame gives these panels a very elegant appearance, though they are our
                        most expensive option as the glass must be thicker to make it sturdier.
